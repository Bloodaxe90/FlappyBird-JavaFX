<h1 align="center">Flappy Bird with JavaFX</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>
After learning Java, I decided I wanted to learn JavaFX to help me build nicer-looking UIs, as I did not like using Swing. This is the first project I built after learning JavaFX and is a direct evolution of https://github.com/Bloodaxe90/Flappy-Bird.  
</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
    <li>
        <strong>Apache Maven</strong>: This project uses Maven to manage dependencies and build.
    </li>

<p>
Run the main method in the Application class

<h2>Controls:</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Results:</h2>
