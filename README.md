<h1 align="center">Flappy Bird with JavaFX</h1>

<p>
After learning Java, I decided I wanted to learn JavaFX to help me build nicer-looking UIs, as I did not like using Swing. This is the first project I built after learning JavaFX and is a direct evolution of https://github.com/Bloodaxe90/Flappy-Bird.  
The project uses the Minimax algorithm to play Tic Tac Toe against a player. I have also implemented two instances of the controller class â€” one with alpha-beta pruning and one without.
